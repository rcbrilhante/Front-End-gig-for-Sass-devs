### REQUIREMENTS

Font sizes, colors, etc, don't have to be the exactly the same. We give more value to those who **DON'T** any library to produce the result. Anything can be done using only with HTML and Sass but if you have to use Javascript fell free to use the file on `src/assets/js/main.js`. All images are provided in `src/assets/images/` folder. Amaze us with your awesome code :D

&nbsp;

### FINISH

When you finish you should run `gulp build` to generate all files into the `docs/` folder.

&nbsp;

### TECH

The source files (editable) are located in the `src/` folder.
To ensure the integrity of the project you should only edit these files inside this folder.
The gulp scripts are able to handle with preprocessing (html, sass, etc...)

&nbsp;

### OUTPUT

The output should be a responsive version of these next images.
